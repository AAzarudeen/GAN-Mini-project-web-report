  <p class="content">
    &emsp;&emsp;This mini project proposes a novel idea using the GENERATIVE
    AI (GAN) in architectrue. The goal of this mini project is to generate a
    architectral design for a given plot area. In this project there are two
    GANs involved one is the GAN which will help us to clean the images i.e.
    the raw datas which were collected for the training of the plot generation
    GAN. The role of our team in this mini project was to clean the data i.e.
    the images of various plot designed by various architects to train the
    cleaning GAN. Raw images are collected using webscraping method those images
    are based on the North American and Europe region. Those images
    are to be cleaned the way to train the GAN model. As a part of this mini-project
    a Auto Encoder code was given with some intentional bugs for learning purpose.
    Link to the autoencoder code <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YXgmUbrE39TL55OBcqjj4D7O4duTYWiC?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Plant denoising</a>

  <h2 class="topic-title">Method</h2>
  <h2 class="subtopic-title">1-Problem Statement</h2>
  <p class="content">
    &emsp;&emsp;Plot designed by the architects are always a time consuming
    work for them and also most of the time based on the customer's
    constrainds it take lot of work and time. To reduce the plot designing
    time we are going to bulid a GAN AI model which can generate the Plots
    based on the user's or customer's prompt. The role given for us is to clean
    as many as images possible to train the GAN.
  </p>
  <h2 class="subtopic-title">2-Data Collection</h2>
  <p class="content">
    &emsp;&emsp;In the initial stage we were given a data consisting images around 6000
    which were download in bulk using webscraping method. Those 6000 images are splited among
    the 6 teams for our team we got around 1000 images and in those images many images were
    irrelavent and most of images were so blury and uneditable. The number of images which were
    good to edit (or) clean were around 400. Other than that we got a synthatic dataset of images
    about 70. The synthatic images were called Robin dataset.

  <h3>The images from Robin dataset</h3>

  <h2 class="subtopic-title">3-Data Cleaning</h2>
  <p class="content">
    &emsp;&emsp;From the collected 6000 images 1000 images where splited with in the teams.
    For our team we got 1000 images and from the 1000 images some images were courpted and some images
    are irrelavent to the domin since it was a bulk download and webscraping. And there were many duplication
    within our Team.
    <br>
    We user a open source software called <a href="https://github.com/ermig1979/AntiDupl">AntiDupl</a>. This problem
    was with all the teams. So make the proess quick a python script was written to remove the duplicates.

  <h4 class="subtopic-title">3.2 Removing duplicates</h4>
  <p class="content">
    &emsp;&emsp;First we used a python script to remove the images which are duplicates from all the groups.
    we manually deleted the imaegs are courpted and which were irrelavent.

  <h4 class="subtopic-title">3.3 cleaning the raw images</h4>
  <p class="content">
    &emsp;&emsp;We used a photo edting tool named Photopea which is a free alternative for photoshop.
    instead earseing the unwanted text from the images we added lines to over the images layer by layer.
    From one raw image we need to output one is Layout image and another one is outline image.

    <h2>GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK</h2>
<p class="content">
&emsp;&emsp;GAN stands for Generative Adversarial Network. It is a type of neural network architecture that consists of two main components a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data, and the discriminator evaluates the generated data against real data. Both components are trained simultaneously, leading to the improvement of the generator's ability to create realistic data.</p>
<h2>AUTO ENCODER</h2>
<p class="content">
&emsp;&emsp;An autoencoder is a type of neural network designed for unsupervised learning. It consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses the input data into a latent representation, and the decoder reconstructs the original data from this representation. Autoencoders are often used for tasks such as data denoising, feature learning, and dimensionality reduction.

During cleaning the image many teams faced issues in multiple ways like using the photopea tool and regularizing the output for input since there was a variability in the data it was hard to clean image in different scenario and another problem in this project was debuging the Auto encoder code for denoising the image was one of the biggest challenges in the project since theoretically, auto encoders are very new to our team It was hard to implement it.</p>

  <p class="content">
    &emsp;&emsp;As a part of data cleaning process our team was able to clean upto 180 images including the robin dataset.
    Our team was able to learn what are the diffculties in cleaning a dataset for training a GAN model.
    Came to know about what are autoencoders and they are used in the development of GAN.
