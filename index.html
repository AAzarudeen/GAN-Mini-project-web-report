    <p class="content">
      &emsp;&emsp;This mini project proposes a novel idea using the GENERATIVE
      AI (GAN) in architectrue. The goal of this mini project is to generate a
      architectral design for a given plot area. In this project there are two
      GANs involved one is the GAN which will help us to clean the images i.e.
      the raw datas which were collected for the training of the plot generation
      GAN. The role of our team in this mini project was to clean the data i.e.
      the images of various plot designed by various architects to train the
      cleaning GAN. Raw images are collected using webscraping method those images 
      are based on the North American and Europe region. Those images 
      are to be cleaned the way to train the GAN model. As a part of this mini-project
      a Auto Encoder code was given with some intentional bugs for learning purpose.
    </p>
    <h2 class="topic-title">Method</h2>
    <h2 class="subtopic-title">1-Problem Statement</h2>
    <p class="content">
      &emsp;&emsp;Plot designed by the architects are always a time consuming
      work for them and also most of the time based on the customer's
      constrainds it take lot of work and time. To reduce the plot designing
      time we are going to bulid a GAN AI model which can generate the Plots
      based on the user's or customer's prompt. The role given for us is to clean 
      as many as images possible to train the GAN.
    </p>
    <h2 class="subtopic-title">2-Data Collection</h2>
    <p class="content">
      &emsp;&emsp;In the initial stage we were given a data consisting images around 6000
      which were download in bulk using webscraping method. Those 6000 images are splited among 
      the 6 teams for our team we got around 1000 images and in those images many images were 
      irrelavent and most of images were so blury and uneditable. The number of images which were
      good to edit (or) clean were around 400.

    <p class="content">
      &emsp;&emsp;This project consisits of two GANs one is for cleaning the
      architectrue images to train the GAN which will produce the images i.e.
      the architectrue.

      <li>The first image is the input for this cleaning GAN.</li>

        The second figure is the layout generated for the original plot image.

    <h4 class="subtopic-title">2. Plot generation GAN</h4>
    <p class="content">
      &emsp;&emsp;The second GAN is for generating the plot for the given area.
      Input will be like 500 sq.ft and the output will be the images generated
      like the figures below:
